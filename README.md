agcb trying to understand flexbox



DISCLAIMER.. this document is for agcb only.. I am
trying to teach myself flexbox and assume that no one
would benefit from this besides myself. Much more informed
people have written at length on the topic and I offer no useful
insights. 
This is for me to express myself only..
thank you....

##...like shoes hanging from Telephone Wires
A useful analogy for me has been a wooden box w/ a 
string tied across from one end to the other.
Beads are hanging from the string like shoelaces on Electric Wires. 
The Box is the Parent.
The String is the Main Axis and the
beads on the string represent the children.
The Parent Container and It's Children.
It's children that live on a string.
This can be a way to categorize the flexboxLanguage. 

Apparently web designers used to have to resort to "floats"
in the past and other techniques that felt counter-intuitive.


Starting on the next line i will lay out all possible declarations...
#First the Parent Containers.
<ol>
<li>display: flex; /* or inline-flex */</li>
<li>flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;</li>
<li>flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;</li>

<li>justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;</li>
<li>align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;</li>
<li>flex-flow: row wrap;</li>
</ol>

#Now the Children.
<ol>
	<li>order: <integer>;</li>
	<li>flex-grow: <number>; /* default 0 */</li>
	<li>flex-shrink: <number>; /* default 1 */</li>
	<li>flex-basis: <length> | auto; /* default auto */</li>
	<li> align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;</li>
	<li>flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]</li>

</ol>

# Both ending w/ the ShortHands
<ul>
	<li>One for the Children, and One for the Parent.</li>
	<li>Flex direction and flex wrap can be combined with the shorthand property flex-flow</li>
	<li>Grow, Shrink, and Basis can be done as simply....flex:</li>
</ul>
