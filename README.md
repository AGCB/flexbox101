agcb trying to understand flexbox

##Deciding on Ideas.
A useful analogy for me has been a wooden box w/ a string tied across from one end
to the other. Beads on the string represent the children.They are the plants or shoes strung on a telephone wire.
We imagine the telephone wire as the Main Axis.... Vertical would be Cross Axis.
The Parent Container and It's Children.
This can be a way to categorize the language.
There is also the idea of Vanilla-Idioma words and Flex-Dashes.
Flex dashes are obviously part of the spec since they start w/ "flex-"
Vanilla Idiomas are not intuitively part of Flexbox spec but are equally important.
